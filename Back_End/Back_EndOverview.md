#### NAME: findOneSong(name, randomFlag)
+ **DESCRIPTION:** The function will take the song title as @name and the random song parameter as @randomFlag from the url, which is sent by the front-end. Both @name and @randomFlag are string datatypes. @name can be anything inside a string, but @randomFlag should be 'True' or 'False' only. If the "Feeling Lucky" or "Random Song" buttons were pressed on the front-end, then @randomFlag will be 'True' and if the "Search" button was pressed, then @randomFlag will be 'False'.  In the pipeline, a search query will be sent to the database containing @name and @randomFlag.  Then, information about the song is collected from the database.  If there are multiple songs with the same name, all data for all of the songs will be collected.  The data is then passed to the predict function of the neural network and a prediction is retrieved.  Finally, the function will return a json message, which contaions one object 'error' only when there is no this song title in database or result with objects, 'songName','artist', 'songGenre', 'predictedScore', 'actualGenre, 'songScore', 'modelScore', 'error', when the song is in the database.
+ **EXAMPLES:** For example, 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/song/enter song/True', @name is 'enter song' and @randomFlag is 'True'
