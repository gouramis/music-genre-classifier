# ECS171 music genre classifier
This is a Music Genre Classifier built as a website for ECS 171 - Introduction to Machine Learning.
Users can enter in a song title and the result will be a predicted genre. We have split the project into 4 teams.The Data Management team that analyzed and formatted the data. The Machine Learning team used the data from the Data Management team to make the best model for classifying songs. The Front End team designed the website and its interactions to server. The Back End team answered requests from the front end team by giving a prediction for a given song in addition to putting our website on AWS.
